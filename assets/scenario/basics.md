## Tutorial
You start off as a fresh grad with a Bachelors in Startupology. You've been
accepted as a single founder to the prestigious "Orange Place" startup
accelerator.

First stop: Office Hours! Your advisor, Papa Sucre, greets you and gives you a
Toot Oriole-style tutorial on the basics of gameplay. He'll mention in
particular that you need to find some co-founders.

Next, you're released to the common area to network (battle) with other
founders. In between networking adventures you encounter founders who pitch you
on a few different ideas:

- A service for delivering bad news, Somber.io.
- A sales CRM that masquerades as friends of the customer, Trust.me.
- A machine learning startup that analyzes your social media and raises your
  children using phrasing that you would use yourself, called NeverHo.me.

After a few battles you get two founders in the stat/classes that you didn't
specialize in. You return to Papa Sucre and lament that you don't have a product
or market you want to enter in, but he assures you that's not necessary since
you can pivot whenever necessary. With founders and starting capital, you
are sent off into the wider world with the mission of securing office space.

## Starting Areas
Once out into the world, there are a few areas open to you:

- The Tenderloin - A seedy area with a shop where you can buy drugs to increase
  your stats at the cost of withdrawal.
